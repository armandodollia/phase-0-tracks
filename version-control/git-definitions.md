# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
  Version control is the process of working on feature to an application on a separate branch(copy) from the master branch in order to test for errors and experiment without affecting the main trunk of code. Version control also stands for making frequent commits every time there is a change to the code in order to maintain multiple save points you can fall back to in case something went wrong with the new version of the code.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
  A branch is used when adding features or modifying existing code on the master, it allows the creation of a copy of the original master that changes can be made to. This is useful because it allows you to make changes to an application independent of the main program, thus preventing any damage being done to the main trunk of code.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
  A commit is the process of cementing a finalized change into the current branch, allowing for testing. A good commit message clearly explains what changes were made to the code allowing someone to easily discern where and when a specific change was made.

* What is a merge conflict?
  A merge conflict is when a file trying to be merged into a branch is different than the existing file in the branch, this requires for the conflicting versions of these two files to be rectified before merging.
